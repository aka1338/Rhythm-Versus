# Rhythm-Versus
 
Rhythm based multiplayer game

Created using Unity

Input is managed through InputController

All gamestate related functionality can be found inside GameManager. 

All audio related functionality is controlled through the Conductor class using FMOD Integration.

BeatSystem is able to take in a song and pull FMOD timeline data after being assigned an FMOD EventInstance. 

All menus are managed using the ViewManager. 

Still very much a work in progress. Feel free to look around!
